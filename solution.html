        </h2>

    <p>
        When children transition from reading picture books to novels, their engagement and interest often 
        declines, leading to life-long reading deficiencies.  According to Deloitte, over 1 million Canadian 
        children are estimated to have reading skills below their grade level.  Every child deserves to 
        live a rich and fulfilling life that comes with the ability to read.  We need to make it easier for 
        everyone to read effectively and discover the joy of reading.

        <br>
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            To make the transition to unillustrated chapter books less daunting, BookBuddy scans text of a 
            chapter book and uses artificial intelligence to generate a visual image to assist the reader 
            with comprehension and retention.  Additionally, the reading aid uses AI to generate a multiple 
            choice question to assess the reader’s comprehension. This will make it easier for early readers 
            to develop their passion for reading along with their confidence and proficiency.

            exhaust vents)? What effect does extreme weather have on the Z-Pipe?

        <h2>Assessment of Commercial Viability (Residential Application Of The Z-Pipe)</h2>


        <p>
            Ctrl-Z estimated the cost to produce the Z-Pipe, 
            market demand volume and selling price per unit in developing 
            base case financial projections for the Z-Pipe which provide strong 
            indication that Z-Pipe can be a viable and profitable business.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Initially, we are planning to sell the Z-Pipe to Canadian heating contractors for $149.99, who 
            will, in turn, sell them to homeowners. When the heating contractors meet with their customers 
            to install a new furnace, they can sell the Z-Pipe as a part of the homeowners’ heating solution. 
            In addition, offering a sales commission to the heating contractors should motivate them to sell 
            our Z-Pipe to their customers. Since the Z-Pipe contains no moving parts, it will be 
            maintenance-free. In the unlikely situation that the Z-Pipe fails, the heating contractor can 
            either repair it or return it to us for replacement. As the heating contractors are keen to sell 
            ancillary products to homeowners and are licensed for heating installation, they will be 
            well-positioned to also sell Z-Pipes. The heating contractors can install it on the furnace 
            exhaust since they know how home heating systems work. We would not work with furnace 
            manufacturers directly because, while the Z-Pipe uses furnace waste heat to generate electricity, 
            it is not a direct component of the furnace. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Based on our financial projections for the residential application of the Z-Pipe, we have 
            determined that it can be a viable business, with an estimated value of $11.5 million. We 
            conservatively estimate that the Z-Pipe will be profitable in year 1, and by year 7, $14.5 
            million of cumulative net income will have been generated on revenues of $36.7 million. Our 
            comprehensive financial projections include material costs, shipping costs, salaries, rental 
            costs, insurance, taxes, advertising, and sales commissions. Our projections have been discussed 
            with a Boston Consulting Group Climate Tech Business Strategy Consultant, Mr. Youssef Aroub, who 
            said that the market for the Z-Pipe is huge.  
        </p>

        <!--<h2>Assessment of Commercial Viability (Commercial Real Estate Application Of The Z-Pipe)</h2>
        <p>
            Not only can our solution be applied in residential settings, but it also has commercial real 
            estate applications. We met with the Energy & Sustainability Manager of a major publicly traded 
            Canadian real estate investment trust to discuss the commercial applications for the Z-Pipe. He 
            proposed applying the Z-Pipe principles to the domestic hot water recirculating pump at one of his 
            200-unit apartment complexes.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Using the information provided by the Manager, we calculated that the reduction in energy 
            consumption from use of the Z-Pipe would result in $294 of electricity savings per year. 
            With the upfront cost of $2,400 for the commercial version of the Z-Pipe, it will have paid 
            for itself after eight years of use. Over the remaining 12 years of its approximate 20-year 
            lifetime, the owners will save $3,500 cumulatively.
